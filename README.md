# MatrixHandler

---

## Description
MatrixHandler is a C# project focused on implementing and testing operations for two-dimensional matrices. It demonstrates core mathematical operations and includes unit tests to verify functionality, making it a valuable example of object-oriented programming and test-driven development.

---

## Features
- **Matrix Operations**: Implementation of basic matrix operations such as addition, multiplication, and transposition.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes unit tests to ensure correctness and robustness of the implemented operations.
- **Modular Code**: Organized in a modular way for easy maintenance and extension.
